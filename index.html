This involves placing the HVAC unit in an appropriate location, connecting the system to your ductwork (or installing new ducts if necessary), and making sure that electrical and gas connections are set up correctly.
4.	Testing and Calibration: After installation, the technician will thoroughly test the system to ensure it’s functioning properly. This includes checking for air leaks, verifying proper airflow, and calibrating the thermostat to ensure accurate temperature control.
